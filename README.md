## Feedreader Testing

###  Functionality

This project uses jasmine to test a feed reader website. Tests include:

* RSS Feeds
** Feeds has been defined
** Each feed has a URL defined and that the URL is not empty
** Each feed has a name defined and that the name is not empty 

* The menu
** The menu element is hidden by default
** The menu changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked

* Initial Entries
** When the loadFeed function is called and completes its work, there is at least a single .entry element within the .feed container.

* New Feed Selection
** When a new feed is loaded by the loadFeed function that the content actually changes.

You can download the code, unzip it, then open index.html, or play it on github page: https://direction123.github.io/Udacity-Feedreader-Testing/
